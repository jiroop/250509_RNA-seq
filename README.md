# 250509_RNA-seq
RNA-seq analysis of two proprietary yeast strains

## Overview

This repository contains a modular RNA-Seq analysis workflow designed for differential gene expression analysis of two brewing yeast strains across four fermentation timepoints. The real strain names have been concealed and for the purposes of this publicly available analysis are named "Strain A" and "Strain B".

This pipeline handles everything from raw read quality control to differential expression analysis and visualization between stains and across timepionts.

## Features

(DEFAULTs - update these when appropriate)
- Complete RNA-Seq analysis workflow from raw reads to biological insights
- Quality control reporting with MultiQC integration
- Flexible alignment options using [STAR/HISAT2/etc.]
- Transcript quantification with [Salmon/featureCounts/etc.]
- Differential expression analysis using DESeq2/edgeR
- Comprehensive visualization suite for exploratory data analysis
- Reproducible workflow with version-controlled environments
- Detailed documentation and example datasets
